# Genetic-Sequence-Algorithm
The project find the genetic sequence alignmnet in both memory-effecient approach and space-effecient apporach.

### How to Run the file
- Clone the repository
- Run the command bash basic.sh <inputfile.txt> to find the sequence alignment using the basic approach and run the command bash basic.sh <inputfile.txt> to find the sequence alignment using the memory effecient approach.
- The output will be created in output.txt file. with the alignment and the minimum cost for the alignment. The plot also helps us to identify the effectiveness.
